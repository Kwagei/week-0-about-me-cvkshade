        <!--My Experience-->
        <h6>My KIT Experience</h6>
        <p>My experience at KIT has been amazing, strange but understandable. <br>
        The lesson is great, the fail fast tecnique seem to be a facinating mechanism <br> that I feel will solidify our learning.
        <br>Overall everything seems good so far.    
        </p>
